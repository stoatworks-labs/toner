#
# Each check answers a question none of the others can:
#
#   build         a FRESH universal Release build. Not the dev build: CMake
#                 latches the architecture list at the first target, so the
#                 only build worth measuring is one configured from nothing.
#   shaders       does every shader compile, through a real GLSL compiler
#                 (tools/check-shaders.sh, which CI runs too), on the exact
#                 strings `totest --dump-shaders` writes.
#   demo          the browser demo's copy of every shader is still the
#                 plugin's, character for character (demo/tools/check_shaders.py).
#   offline      the checks that need no GL:
#                   --laws        every control law against its statement,
#                                 and the model's own promises
#                   --names       nothing a host will silently truncate; the
#                                 host reads SW Toner / TO01 / effect
#   physics       every rendering check, at TWO rasters: 320x180, which is
#                 what CI renders at, and 1280x720. Each is measured out of
#                 the picture:
#                   --fixedpoint  a ramp copied n times is the tone curve
#                                 composed n times: two plateaus, a
#                                 transition that narrows every copy
#                   --fringe      a solid's centre/edge density ratio falls
#                                 with its width as the strip field says; a
#                                 one-pixel line prints full; the electrode
#                                 removes the dip
#                   --drum        the drum's repeats are one circumference
#                                 apart, whole-pixel and fractional
#                   --starvation  density down a page of constant coverage
#                                 follows the depletion-recovery closed form
#                   --skew        after n generations a line has turned by
#                                 the sum of the per-generation skews
#                   --ae          grey paper comes out paper white; a grey
#                                 patch lands where T( patch / paper ) says
#                   --negative    every one of those FAILS on a perturbed
#                                 copier
#   pipe          the fleet's --pipe contract: whole frames only, a cue naming
#                 no control refused, and exit 1 -- not a silent 0, not a
#                 SIGPIPE 141 -- on a failed render or a closed stdout, the
#                 last proved with `| head -c 1`.
#   sweep         does every control change the picture.
#   bench         the render cost, for the record. Not pass/fail.
#   registration  does the bundle contain a plugin at all -- a file-scope
#                 CFFGLPluginInfo nothing names, which a linker may drop while
#                 still producing a bundle that loads and exports plugMain.
#   lipo          is the build really universal.
#   plist         does CFBundleExecutable name the binary that is on disk.
#   codesign      the exact command the release job runs, against a copy.
#   oxbow         a real FFGL host loads the bundle and reports the name, id
#                 and type it sees -- the name field is not null-terminated
#                 and a host truncates silently past 16 characters.
